## Nonfunctional Use Cases

* Should be secure (HTTPS)

* Should be well documented

## Story/Epic Ideas

* Create a use-case diagram
* Write use case descriptions
* Write README.md
* Design the application
* Design the REST API endpoints (Epic)
* Design a normalized database schema (Epic)
  * Design a table for participants
  * Design a table for administrators
  * Design a table for applications
  * Design a table for sponsor info
  * Design a table for authorization/api keys(?)
  * Design a table for notifications
  * Design a table for the schedule
  * Design a table for mentors
* Implement REST API (Epic)

## Other Notes

Implementation details that are probably important.

* The [HackIllinois] api is a really good resource for ideas.
* Because of CORS, we shouldn't/can't use cookies for authorization. We will
  probably need to use some kind of authorization/api key.
